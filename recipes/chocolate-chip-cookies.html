    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These chocolate chip cookies come out of the oven with golden‑brown edges and soft, tender centers that stay chewy long after they cool. Each bite blends rich butter, warm vanilla, and pockets of gooey chocolate that create that classic, nostalgic flavor everyone loves. They’re simple, comforting, and just a little indulgent — the kind of cookie that makes your kitchen smell like home.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 and 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 cups semisweet or dark chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375&deg; fahrenheit.</li>
        
        <li>In a bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        
        <li>In a separate large bowl, beat the softened butter with both sugars until light and fluffy.</li>
        
        <li>Beat in the eggs one at a time, then mix in the vanilla.</li>
        
        <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture until just combined.</li>
        
        <li>Fold in the chocolate chips.</li>
        
        <li>Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto an ungreased baking sheet, leaving space for spreading.</li>
        
        <li>Bake for 8-10 minutes, until the edges are golden but the centers still look soft.</li>
        
        <li>Let them rest on the baking sheet for a couple of minutes before transferring to a wire rack.</li>
    </ol>
