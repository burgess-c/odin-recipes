    <h3>Crust and Filling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 unbaked pie crust</li>
        <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>14 ounce full fat coconut milk</li>
        <li>1 cup half-and-half</li>
        <li>2/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup sweetened shredded coconut</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Whipped Cream</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 and 1/2 cups cold heavy cream or heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375&deg; and fully blind bake the pie crust. Let cool completely.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Make the coconut filling:</strong> Whisk the egg yolks and cornstarch together. Set aside. Whisk the coconut milk, half-and-half, granulated sugar, and salt together in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisking occasionally, bring to a boil. Boil for 2 minutes, then reduce temperature to medium-low heat. Once boiling, remove about 1/2 cup of the mixture and, in a slow and steady stream, whisk into the egg yolk and cornstarch mixture. Keep those egg yolks moving so they don’t scramble. In a slow and steady stream, pour and whisk the egg yolk mixture into the pot. </li>
        
        <li>The pudding will immediately begin to bubble and thicken. Stand back and use caution as the bubbles may burst. Whisk and cook for 1 minute and 30 seconds. Remove from heat and stir in the coconut, butter, vanilla, and coconut extract (if using).</li>
        
        <li>Pour warm filling into cooled pie crust. Cover tightly with plastic wrap directly on the surface of the pudding (to prevent a skin from forming) and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or overnight until chilled and thickened. Pie may be refrigerated for up to 1 day.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Make the whipped cream:</strong> Pour warm filling into cooled pie crust. Cover tightly with plastic wrap directly on the surface of the pudding (to prevent a skin from forming) and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or overnight until chilled and thickened. Pie may be refrigerated for up to 1 day.</li>
        
        <li>Pipe or spread the whipped cream on top. Garnish with extra coconut, if desired. Chill the pie uncovered up to a few hours or you can serve it immediately.</li>
        
        <li>Cover leftovers and store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.</li>
    </ol>
