TOP HTML Project: Recipes

This is a pure HTML website for the "Recipes" project in The Odin Project's Foundations course.

Contains a index.html homepage which links to 3 different recipe pages. Each recipe page displays an image, description, ingredients, and steps to follow for the listed recipe. Each image contains the required attribute and link to its source.

Skills Demonstrated: 

 - Creating multiple webpages in different folders and connecting them together with relative links
 
 - Using various HTML tags to structure a webpage with content such as images, paragraphs, headings, and ordered/unordered lists.

 - Using git to add changes to the staging area, commit those changes with a descriptive message, and finally push those commits to the repo.
